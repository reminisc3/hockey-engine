# HockeyEngine

NHL style hockey simulation engine written in Angular and Material UI. Currently in the early stage of development, but some anticipated features include:

- Manage teams, players, coaches, stadiums
- Simulate games
- Franchise / GM mode

## Getting Started

TBD

## Serverless Database

This project aims to use IndexedDB as a NoSQL solution to store all application data. This means that you can "play" from anywhere using any supported browser.
